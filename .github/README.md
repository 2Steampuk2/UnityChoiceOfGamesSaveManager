# Choice of Games Save Manager

![Screenshot](MainWindow.png)

This is a hobby Unity project that helps manage save files for [Choice of Games](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Choice%20of%20Games) and [Hosted Games](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Hosted%20Games) that are published on **Steam** platform (tested on Windows only). Note that this application **doesn't allow** you to edit your save files, it just allows you to save your progress manually and/or automatically.

The project is created with *Unity 5.6.2f1*, so it can be modified on pretty much any Unity version. For convenience, a portable pre-built Windows executable of the application can be found at the [Releases](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityChoiceOfGamesSaveManager/releases) page.

## HOW TO

- **Game Save Directory:** You first need to select the desired Choice of Game's Steam save directory. Steam save paths have the following format: `{Steam Cloud Save Folder}/{Game ID}
  - *Steam Cloud Save Folder:* You can find out the location of this directory for each OS [here](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/68D2-35AB-09A9-7678)
  - *Game ID:* You can right click the game's shortcut and find this id in the shortcut's URL as follows: `steam://rungameid/{Game ID}`. Alternatively, you can open the game's Store page in a web browser and find the id in the url
  - You must open the game at least once for its save directory to be generated by Steam. Rarely, same games may store their save files in different directories (e.g. *Heroes Rise* trilogy stores all its save files in the first book's save directory so you have to choose that directory for each game of that trilogy)
- **CoG Save Storage:** Saves generated by this application will be stored at this location. You don't have to give different storage locations for different games because the application automatically groups saves per game
- **Manual Saves:** You can save the game manually at any time by clicking the **Save** button. To change the save's name, you can either type the name into the input field or click the dropdown button and pick one of the previous manual saves' name
- **Automated Saves:** Application automatically saves the game as you progress through the story (i.e. whenever you progress to the next page of the game). This way, you can undo your latest choices. Maximum number automated saves can be configured via **# of Saves**. Once this number is reached, oldest automated saves will be overwritten by the new automated saves
- You can load a save by clicking its name. For the load operation to work, however, you **must** close the game first and wait a little while for the *Steam Cloud Save* to finish (if enabled). Then, you can load the desired save file and launch the game again
- To switch between previously explored Choice of Games (i.e. without having to change *Game Save Directory* manually each time), you can click the current game's title ("*- communitycollegehero -*" in the screenshot) and choose the target game from the list

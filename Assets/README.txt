This save manager is a hobby project of mine and I'm working on it alone,
so there may be some bugs that slip my attention. When you encounter such
bugs and report them to me, I'll try to fix them ASAP. While reporting bugs,
please include the contents of "CoG Save Manager_Data/output_log.txt" with
your bug report. Any errors encountered by the save manager are logged to
that file and these error messages can help me debug the issues much faster.
